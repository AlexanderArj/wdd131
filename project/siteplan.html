            <h2>Site Name:</h2>
            <h3>Alexander the Grea<span>Tourist</span></h3>
            <p>
                I think it's a catchy name that includes the author's name and the word “tourist,”
                which gives an idea of the purpose of the website. It's also a play on words with
                the name of Alexander the Great, since on one of the author's trips, he remembered
                the connection between his name and this historical figure. One of the sites visited
                also has the name Alexander. If necessary, a subtitle could also be added.
                The domain could be something like greatourist.org, if available.
            </p>

            <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of the website is to provide a tourist guide to places the author has visited.
                It includes photos, recommendations, and opinions on places to visit in those countries,
                as well as links to official websites for tourist attractions.
            </p>

            <h2>Scenarios:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm a solo female traveler interested in safety. Are there any specific tips or areas to be cautious about in the countries you've visited, particularly Colombia or Brazil?</li>
                <li>I'm planning a trip to Estonia and want to know if there are any good day trips from Tallinn. Do you have recommendations for things to do outside the capital?</li>
                <li>What are some of the must-see tourist attractions in Barranquilla, Colombia?</li>
                <li>What are some of the must-see tourist attractions in Sao Paulo, Brazil?</li>
                <li>What are the requirements for entering Estonia as a tourist?</li>
            </ul>
